	<string>Understanding generation structure helps us to better forecast what may be on the rise in the future.

Looking at the industrial era, we could have forecasted that the social events such as WW2 would have had an impact on consumers wanting information faster – thus the penetration of televisions in the home.  With the advent and acceptance of television, it drew consumers to want more even faster and we began to leverage technology to gain information in an instant.  Smartphones and social networks have had some of the quickest adoptions by consumers due to the ability to have information in a matter of seconds and no longer do we have to wait.

Generation Y is the largest population since the Boomers.  The have similar and different value systems than the group but have a strong spending power over their lifetime.  They will use these dollars to drive behavior of manufacturers and service industry based on their value systems – clear communication, authentic values, transparent manufacturing practices.  Business cannot afford to anger this group because they will walk away and spread the word quickly through their social networks.

By the year 2042 the Department of Labor estimates the US will be of majority Latino descent for the first time.  Millennials are leading that charge.  If you look at a microcosm of Los Angeles School District – 72% of kids k – 12 are of Latino descent.  This means that the aculturation and adoption of US values needs to be watched to determine how we provide and anticipate the needs of this new consumer.  It won’t be purely Latino but a blend of values and we need to determine which are kept and which are adopted.</string>

	<string>Shifting Demographics:  Boomers are aging = taste buds less sensitive, bolder flavors, revising dessert, also more apt to go to eat out of home more often than the hyounger generations.
  - Generation x:  in full family mode now, their kids influence decision heavily 
  - Generation Y:  largest generation since Boomers, really look to have their ‘values’ met through choices such as local, Chipotle and Panera – about authenticity, transparency and doing good for all

Channel blurring:  we are no longer a society of eat in the home with a scratch meal or eat out of the home at a restaurant; choices abound from the deli set at a grocery story, costco rotisserie chickens, c-stores moving into more fresh prepared (WaWa/Sheetz specifically) and gas station/express choices

Health and wellness:  less about health and more about proactive association of what you eat is largely how you feel.  Consumers, more than every, looking to balance their diets and doing less fad dieting – trends such as Gluten Free will likely die down, high protein consumption is big right now and will likely continue until protei nprices reach a level that make it uncomfortable for consumers – with greater demand outside of the US, we can expect to see animal based protein increase

Globalization:  the borders of the world are very loose now, due to the instant connectivity through various media sources, we are a society inflouenced by the farthest reaches of the earth.  Flavors, foods, preparation are shared in an instant.  Food is the #1 thing photographed and uploaded on social media around the world.</string>

	<string>Due to growing up with a more diverse set of friends and introduction of more ethnic foods at a younger age, the Millennial does enjoy a broader flavor experience than other generations.  Look to provide options on the menu that highlight these notes and help to drive distinctiveness.

The overlap of smokey and bold between millennials and X’ers is an indication of why BBQ has been strong for the last few years on menus.  They both enjoy those flavors and create a ‘sweet spot’
 Japanese (tepanyaki or sushi) became popular for Xers during the growing years of Millennials.  This rich umami experience is one that has been widely embraced by the population for the combination of sweet, salty, meaty and sometimes spicy flavors. 

In terms of the future, the base flavors of mexican, Italian and Chinese won’t go away but they will evolve into the regional cuisines from those cultures – look for Quoaxan from Mexico, Naeopolitan from Italian and Mandarin from Chinese.  Millennials just take it to a more authentic place.
 The battle for share of stomach is changing radically as other forms of foodservice compete directly against restaurants.

In particular, retailers are vying for foodservice visits with growing success. The hottest retailers, like Whole Foods or Wegmans, offer their customers an experience far beyond just gathering groceries; they even have their own ever-more-sophisticated onsite restaurants that rival the traditional restaurant sector. At Italian-style food emporium Eataly, shoppers can stroll from dinner at a traditional Neapolitan pizzeria to a dessert detour at the Nutella Bar; in between, they can watch pasta being made and buy some for tomorrow’s dinner.

Beyond retail foodservice, there are up-and-coming enterprises that deliver fresh food to consumers’ doors, like Amazon Fresh.

Vending machines at offices and colleges feed consumer demand for higher-level convenience without compromising quality. The trend extends to hot entrées, adult beverages and even milkshakes.
The Farmer’s Fridge offers handcrafted salads, wraps and snacks, attractively packed in distinctive Mason jars, vended from kiosks in office buildings and 7-Eleven stores in Chicago.
Healthy vending company H.U.M.A.N. proves that vending machines can offer more than just candy and sodas. The Media Mogul includes, among other things, healthy bars, protein drinks, and fruit juices. The video screen above the vending machine displays health tips and shows the nutritional values of the products. Besides the Media Mogul, H.U.M.A.N. offers seven other healthy vending machines, including the &apos;Hot Human&apos;, with healthy warm snacks, and the &apos;Arctic Human,&apos; with healthy frozen food.</string>
